# CHARLES DARWIN (1809-1882)

Charles Darwin is well known for his theory of evolution. His work was said to be the foundation on which biology as a subject was born.

Charles Darwin proved that all species have evolved over the years from common ancestors. He was able to come up with this theory through careful study and observation of different natural specimen on a 5 year voyage around the world. Darwin realized that there were some similarities between some species and the only reasonable explanation of this was if they had all evolved from one particular species.

Charles Darwin is widely known through his research and belief that species survived a process called natural selection. This meant that any species who could adapt to changing conditions of its habitat were able to thrive and those that could not adapt died off. Sort of like survival of the fittest.‚Äù
