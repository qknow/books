# Summary

Plants undergo cycles in order to produce new young ones that also mature to continue the cycle.

Okro seeds are grown directly in clayey and loamy soil and they require warm weather conditions. Maize seeds are dried up before planting them directly in the soil. They take 90-120 days (3-4months) to become fully matured. During the life cycle of okro and maize they are attacked by pests and diseases.
