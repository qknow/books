# Development of zygote and fetus

The fetus is also known as the embryo.  The zygote develops into the embryo through division of cells.  The embryo attaches itself to the uterus and the development takes place there. This development stage occurs in the uterus. During the embryo development an organ is formed, this organ is called the **placenta**. The placenta is connected to the embryo by another organ known as the **umbilical cord**. This organ is connected to the mother and serves as a medium between the embryo and the mother. It helps the fetus receive nutrients and oxygen from the mother, the fetus also gets rid of their waste substances through this same organ.

The placenta plays a major role in the embryo development. Let us look at some of its functions:

1.	 The placenta is between the embryo and the mother where blood circulation of the mother takes place by diffusion
2.	The fetus receives nutrients and oxygen from the mother through the placenta.
3.	The placenta also prevents harmful substances from entering into the embryo.
4.	It also removes waste substances of its metabolism such as carbon dioxide and urea from the embryo
5.	Show pictures.


**NB:**  Not every harmful substance are prevented from entering into the embryo from them other practices such as smoking and taking in alcohol during pregnancy are very dangerous to the fetus and those practices can affect fetus development.
