# Diffusion in Animals

**Let's look at how diffusion takes place in Animals**

The food that we take into our system can never be used in the same form that it was taken.  Carbohydrates for example, when taken in is converted into glucose.  The glucose is the end product of carbohydrates after digestion.  The glucose is found in the intestine but is needed in the blood.

So how does the glucose move from the intestine (high concentration) to the blood (low concentration)?

This can only happen through diffusion.  The glucose passes through the walls of the intestine by a process called **diffusion into the blood.**
