# Sperms

The sperm that is produced, undergoes a process in order to be active.  The sperms mix with fluid secreted by Cowper and prostate glands to form semen.  This semen contains the sperm produced by the testes.  The semen is the fluid ejaculated during sexual intercourse.  This semen contains fluid which protects the sperm against excess acid in the vagina.  The sperm is very tiny and cannot be seen with the naked eye.
