# Osmosis in Yam (II)

**Conclusion:**  The water in the water trough moved through the semi-permeable membrane of the unboiled yam of B into the salt solution in its cavity through osmosis.  This is because the water molecules in the water trough is highly concentrated as compared to the salt solution in the cavity and this made it possible

In setup A, the water concentration of water trough is the same as the water concentration in the cavity of A and this made the levels of both the, water in the yam cavity of A and the water trough to be the same.

In set-up C, the yam was boiled and this made the membrane of the yam impermeable.  Water molecules cannot pass through its tissue even though the water molecule in the water trough is highly water concentrated than the salt solution in the cavity


With this experiment, the conditions required for osmosis are;

1.	The two solutions (the water in the water trough and the salt solution in the yam cavity) must be separated by a semi-permeable membrane

2.	The two solutions (the water in the water trough and the salt solution in the yam cavity) should have different concentration.

This is why the salt solution in yam cavity B rose and the water in yam cavity A remained the same.
