# Multiple Births

During birth, some women do give birth to more than one baby at the same moment and this is referred to as multiple births.

Under multiple births we have the following:

**Twins**; two babies born by the same woman, at the same time.

**Triplets** are the birth of three babies by the same woman.

**Quadruplets** are the birth of four babies by the same woman etc.
