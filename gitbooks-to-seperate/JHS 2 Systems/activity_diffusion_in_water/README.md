# Activity: Diffusion in water

**Material:**  Potassium permanganate, water, beaker, pair of tongs

**Method:**  Put water into a beaker gently drop and a few crystals of potassium permanganate into the water with a pair of tongs

State your observations when you dropped the potassium permanganate after 20 minutes

The potassium permanganate will spread evenly in the water You can also use ink from a pen to perform this experiment.  You will notice that there will be more ink at the region it was dropped (high concentration) with little or no colour of ink in the other region (low concentration).  The ink will spread from the area of high concentration to where there is no ink (low concentration) after a few minutes. So, the concentration of the substance will be uniform everywhere after a while.
