# Factors that affect osmosis

1.	**Concentration gradient**:
The greater the concentration difference, the faster the rate of osmosis

2.	**Temperature:**
The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of osmosis
Example of osmosis in a living cell (human being)

In the human body system, the kidney cleans the blood by filtering out waste substances.  The water which passes through the kidney is reabsorbed back into the blood by the process called osmosis.  The water molecule in the kidney is highly concentrated and this makes it move easily into the blood which has low water concentration

The roots of a plant absorb water from the soil the root of the plant has low water concentration compared to the soil.  This because the mineral salts is more concentrated inside the roots.  The water molecules move from the soil into the root through a process called osmosis.
