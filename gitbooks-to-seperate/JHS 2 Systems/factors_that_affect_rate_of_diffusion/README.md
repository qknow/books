# Factors that affect rate of diffusion

Diffusion occurs in fluids (liquids and gases). It does not happen in solids because solids have fixed points and they are held together by the force of attraction which prevents them from moving freely.  In liquids and gases however, their molecules are in constantly moving randomly and spread through any available space until they are evenly distributed.

Diffusion in gases is faster than in liquids.  This is because there is almost no force of attraction in gas molecules and this makes gas molecules free to move in every direction.

**These are the factors that affect rate of Diffusion;**

1.	**The size of the molecule:**
The smaller the molecule such as gas, the faster the rate of diffusion while the larger the molecules (liquid) the slower the rate of diffusion

2.	**Concentration gradient**:
The greater the concentration difference, the faster the rate of diffusion.

3.	**Temperature**:
The higher the temperature, the faster the rate of diffusion

4.	**State of matter**:
Diffusion in gas molecules is faster than the diffusion in liquids.
