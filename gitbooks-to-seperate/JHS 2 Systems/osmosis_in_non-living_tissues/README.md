# Osmosis in non-living tissues

**Activity:**  Demonstrating osmosis in non-living tissues

**Material:** Retort stand and clamp, thistle funnel, parchment paper, concentrated sugar solution, distilled water, beaker.

**Method:**

1.	Fit a piece of parchment paper over the mouth of a thistle funnel.

2.	Invert the funnel: the covered mouth will be at the bottom and the funnel is filled with concentrated sugar solution and is level with ink

3.	A beaker is filled with water and then the funnel with the concentrated sugar solution is immersed into the beaker containing the water.

4.	Clamp the tube of the thistle-funnel in a vertical position.
5.	Leave the setup for about 6 hours

**Observation:**  The level of the sugar solution in the thistle funnel will rise.  The water in the beaker will reduce

<br>

**Conclusion:**  the water molecule in the beaker is high concentration of water molecules.  The water will move from the beaker into the thistle funnel with the parchment paper serving as a semi-permeable membrane
