# Example 1 of Diffusion

**The Diagram below will help us better understand Diffusion**

The concentration is high in A and with time, it will spread to B.  You can monitor the movement of the molecule when you can see the difference between the two.

Diffusion always moves from high concentration to a low concentration.  An example of this is the movement of carbon dioxide to plants.  We all known plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.  The plants obtain the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere which can be found high up in the air.  The part of the plant which traps carbon dioxide from the air is the leaf.

The leaf needs carbon dioxide from the air.  The carbon dioxide is more concentrated in the air than it is in the leaf.  The carbon dioxide moves from the air (high concentration) to the leaf (low concentration) through the process known as diffusion.
