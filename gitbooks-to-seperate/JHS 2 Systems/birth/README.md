# Birth

This is the process by which the baby is removed from the uterus into the world.  Another name for birth is **parturition**.  The embryo (fetus) after development, comes out as a baby.  Before the baby comes out, there are various processes which will happen and they are as follows:


1.	 The woman would first be in labour.  These are the contractions of highly thickened walls of the uterus.  The contraction is from the uterus to the cervix (where the head of the baby lies).

2.	These contractions result in the breakdown of embryonic membranes due to the force. This also causes the amniotic sack to break allowing the flow of amniotic fluid which lubricates the birth canal.

3.	This lubrication makes the process less difficult. The woman in labour has to push in order for the embryo (fetus) to come out of the womb with the head coming first.

**NB:**  the placenta which was connected to the embryo and the womanâ€™s cut off after birth.  This now makes the baby independent.
