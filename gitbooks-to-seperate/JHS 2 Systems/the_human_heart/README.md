# The Human Heart

The human heart consists of four muscular walled chambers.  These chambers are the right atrium and left atrium at the top and the right ventricle and left ventricle at the bottom.  The heart is divided vertically into two halves, the right atrium and the right ventricle to the right and the left atrium and left ventricle to the left by the septum

The atrium and the ventricle play different roles due to their structure.  The ventricle has a thicker wall compared to the atrium.  The atrium pumps blood to the ventricles which are a short distance away. When the ventricles receive it, they pump the blood to the lungs and other organs of the body due to its thicker walls (ventricles are able to pump blood through long distances).  The blood moves from the atrium to the ventricle in order to reach its destinations.  The heart is made of four valves.  The valves prevent the backflow of blood.  These values are bicuspid, tricuspid and two semi-lunar valves.  The heart is connected by blood vessels (capillaries, veins arteries)
