# Parts and Functions of the Heart

The circulation of blood in the heart is performed by the parts of the heart.  The parts and functions of the circulatory system in humans are:

| Part of the heart | Function|
| -- | -- |
| Vena Cava | Brings deoxygenated blood from all parts of the body to the right atrium |
|Right atrium | Relaxes and expands to receive blood from the anterior vena cava.  It contracts to pump blood into the right ventricle |
| Tricuspid valve| It prevents the back flow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium |
| Right ventricle | It relaxes and expands to receive blood from the right atrium.  It contracts to pump blood into the lungs through pulmonary artery|
| Pulmonary artery | It transports deoxygenated blood from the heart (right ventricle) to the lungs |
| Pulmonary vein | It transports oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart.   |
| Left atrium| It relaxes and expands to receive oxygenated blood from the lungs through the pulmonary vein |
|Bicuspid valve | It prevents the back flow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium.   |
| Left ventricle | It relaxes and expands to receive blood from the left atrium.  It then contracts and pumps the oxygenated blood to all the body parts through aorta |
| Aorta| It is a major blood vessel. The artery that receives oxygenated blood from the left ventricle and distributes it to all the body parts.   |
