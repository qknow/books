# Reproduction in Humans

Reproduction in human beings starts with sexual intercourse between a male and a female.  This is what we refer to as **sexual reproduction**.  Higher animals such as cats and monkeys also undergo sexual reproduction

The male produces the male gamete also commonly known as the **sperms** (spermatozoa).  The female also produces the female gamete also commonly known as the **eggs** (ova)

**NB:**  Spermatozoon (plural spermatozoa) Ovum (plural ova)

When the male gamete (sperm) fuses with the female gamete (ovum), it produces a new structure called the **zygote**.  This zygote develops into a human being.
