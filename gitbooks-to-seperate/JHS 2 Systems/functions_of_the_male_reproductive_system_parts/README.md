# Functions of the male reproductive system parts

| Part | Location | Function |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Cowper gland | This can be found at each side of the base of penis  | This protects the sperms from excessive acid from the vagina by producing a clear, thick secretion purposely for that. |
| Prostate gland  |This is located at the base of the urethra  | This gland makes a mixture of fluid called seminal fluid that mixes the sperm together and is called semen.  This fluid allows sperm to swim and also provide food for them.   |
|Sperm duct (vas deferens) | These are two thin tubes from the testes to the urethra  | This serves as the passage way of sperms  |
| Urethra | This is a long tube that runs through the centre of the penis |This serves as the semen and urine passage.  This makes the urethra urinogenital in function.   |
|Epididymis | This lies close in contact with the external surface of each of the testes  | This stores sperms temporarily.  This is where the sperm is mixed with a fluid secreted by the Cowper’s gland and prostate gland to form the semen in order to keep the sperm alive.  |
| Testes (singular testis)   | These are situated in the lower part of the abdomen.   | These produced sperms thus the male gamete  |
| Scrotum | This is the pouch of skin that hangs below the penis  | It holds and protects the testes  |
|Penis | This is seen in front of the scrotum and outside the human body  | This is organ releases semen into the female’s vagina |
