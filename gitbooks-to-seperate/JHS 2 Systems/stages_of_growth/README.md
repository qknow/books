# Stages of Growth

**Infancy**

This is from the day the baby is born up until to 2 years of age.  An infant is unable to speak initially, but starts sounding out words after a few months when its organs responsible for speaking are well developed.

This stage is also known for increase in size, height and weight of the baby.  During this stage, the baby is supported by the parent because their organs are not well developed.  The child begins to adapt to the new environment and also recognizes the people around it as they become more familiar to it.  The child begins to hear his/her name and can be able to mention names of people and things around them

**Childhood**

This is the age span ranging from 2 years to 12 years. This stage is divided into early childhood (play age) and middle childhood (school age).  Growth in this age is slow compared to the infancy stage.  The child in this age can be able to perform things without any help such as bathing because of the development of their muscles.  The child is also able to talk without any difficulties.  The voice of the child becomes clearer compared to infancy stage.
