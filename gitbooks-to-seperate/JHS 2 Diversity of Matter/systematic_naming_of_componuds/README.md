# SYSTEMATIC NAMING OF COMPONUDS

The Systematic naming is a system of naming chemicals substances or compounds according to the rules of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

**Systematic naming of binary compounds.**

This is made up of only two elements. The name is made up of constituent elements.


**Guidelines for the binary compounds naming.**

The name of the metal element (the positive ion) is written first. Examples of metal elements are Sodium, Magnesium, Aluminium, Potassium, Calcium.

The oxidation number or valency of the first element is written in Roman numerals and placed in a bracket against the name of the first element.

**NB:** When the valency or the oxidation number is one (I), it should not be written against the element. Examples are: Hydrogen Sulphide, Aluminium chloride.

When the oxidation number is more than one (I), it should be written against the first element. Examples are: Zinc (II) chloride, Sulphur (VI) oxide.

The name of the second element usually a non-metal written with its name changed to end in ‘ide’. Examples of such elements are Oxygen, Chlorine, Sulphur.
