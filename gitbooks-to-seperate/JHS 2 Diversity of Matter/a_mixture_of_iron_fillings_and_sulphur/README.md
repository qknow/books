# A mixture of iron fillings and sulphur.

Letâ€™s look at the first experiment involving the mixture of iron fillings and sulphur.

**Experiment	:**	A mixture of iron fillings and sulphur.

**Materials	:**	Iron fillings, powdered sulphur, dilute hydrochloric acid, piece of wood, piece of paper, bar magnet, 2 test tubes, 2 beakers, stopper, water.

**Method:**

Spread a little powdered sulphur on a piece of paper, and bring magnetic bar close to it.
	<br>a. Record your observations.

Put some powdered sulphur into a test tube and half fill the tube with dilute hydrochloric acid.
	<br>b. Record your observations.

Repeat the steps 1 and 2 using iron fillings instead of sulphur.

Put one teaspoonful of powdered sulphur and one teaspoonful of iron fillings into a beaker and mix it well with a piece of wood.

Divide the mixture into two (2) parts.

Put one part of the mixture in a test tube and add water to half fill the tube.

Place a stopper in the mouth of the tube and shake it for 30 seconds in order for the mixture to mix well.

Place the test tube in a rack for two minutes for the mixture to settle.
	<br>c. Record your observations.

<br>

You will observe that the properties of the individual components thus the iron fillings and sulphur does not change. The properties of the individual components are still the same when the iron fillings also react with the hydrochloric acid to produce bubbles of a gas. The behavior of sulphur with a magnet or with hydrochloric acid was also the same whether mixed with iron fillings or not.
