# SOURCES OF WATER

Water, we say is life, all living things need water to survive. Plants need water throughout their lifecycle. They need water to prepare their food. Human beings use water in most of their life activities. The water used by human beings is mostly pure or clean water. The source of the water also influences the purity of it. The water used by humans has undergone all the purification processes making it suitable for usage. Humans mostly depend on pipe borne water.

In rural areas, they mostly depend on rivers, streams, rain water, wells, and boreholes among others.

Most of these sources are treated before use. Contaminated water, when not treated causes water related diseases. Water is boiled to kill the germs in it.

Boreholes usually have a pump fitted to bring the water to the surface. The deeper the hole, the cleaner the water will be. Boreholes are deeper than wells. Shallow wells are mostly contaminated with materials by human beings or animals.

Contaminated water must always be treated before use.
