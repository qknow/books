# Naming of Oxo-acids

Oxo-acids are also two words coming together. They are oxygen and acids. Examples are H2SO4, HNO3.

**Rules for naming oxo-acids.**

The same procedure used in the systematic naming of oxo-anion is used.
Example for H2SO4.

Use the procedure in naming oxo-anion for SO4.
thus: SO42- will be tetraoxosulphate (VI) ion.

Replace the word ‘ion’ at the end of the oxo-anion with the word acid.

This is because of the presence of the element hydrogen of the oxo-acid.

H2SO4 ---->       tetraoxosulphate (VI) acid.
