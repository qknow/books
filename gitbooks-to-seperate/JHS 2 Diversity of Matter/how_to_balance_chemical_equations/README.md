# How to balance chemical equations.

1.  Write the name of Compounds or the word equation.
      Example;

**Nitrogen +  Hydrogen ------>                  Ammonia**

 2,   Replace the reactant and product with symbols and formulae.


3,   Balance the equation by making the number of atoms of each element the same on both sides of the equation.


N2    +   3H2   ------------>                                                   2NH3

4, Hydrogen and Oxygen are balanced later in every chemical equation.

N2  +   3H2 ------>                                 2NH3

Letâ€™s compare if the number of atoms in the equation on the left side is equal to the right side.

**N2  +   3H2 ---->                                 2NH3**
