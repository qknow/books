# METHODS OF SEPARATING MIXTURES (II)

**DECANTATION**

Insoluble solids can be separated from a liquid. This method can be performed in our homes. Insoluble solids are separated from liquids by allowing the mixture to settle at the bottom of the container and the liquid on top of the solid. The liquid can be poured into another empty container in order to separate the two substances.
Example is the mixture of gari and water. Gari and water can be separated by this method.
