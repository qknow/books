# ATOMIC STRUCTURE

Atom is the smallest particles of an element. They cannot be seen with our naked eyes or even with the most powerful microscope. All pictures of atoms seen in books are mental pictures or model of atoms.

Even though atoms are smallest particles, they are made of three smaller particles. They are:

**Electrons:** They move very rapidly in an empty space. The electrons are tiny and negatively charged particles. The electrons are found outside the nucleus.

The nucleus consists of two particles. They are:

**Protons:** They are positively charged particles.

**Neutrons:** They have no charges.
