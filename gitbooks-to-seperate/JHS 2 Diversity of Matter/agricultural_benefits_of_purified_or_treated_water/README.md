# Agricultural benefits of purified or treated water.

Water is important in the production of animals and in the cultivation of crops.

Farm animals depend on water for survival.  Some animals cannot survive on dirty water.  They need purified or treated water.  Providing enough purified or treated water for livestock helps them grow and function well.
