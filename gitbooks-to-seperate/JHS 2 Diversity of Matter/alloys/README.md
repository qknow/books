# ALLOYS

Alloys are mixtures of two or more different metals or of a metal and non-metal.

Alloys are formed in order to improve the properties of a metal. This is because the various metals or non-metals that will be mixed have different properties and all those properties will be benefitted when they are mixed together to form alloys.

**Examples of alloys, their composition and their use**

| ALLOY | COMPOSITION | USES|
| -- | -- | -- |
| Bronze | Copper and Tin  | Used for making statues & medals, coins and bells. |
| Brass| Copper and Zinc  | Used for making statues & medals, jewels, musical instruments. |
| Steel  | Carbon and Iron| Used for making car and machine parts.|
| Duralumin  | Aluminium and Copper  | Used for constructing aircraft. |
| Solder | Lead and Tin| Used for joining electrical components. |

**Importance of Alloys**

They have higher tensile strength.

They are cheaper and have more uses.

They are less likely to rust e.g. Steel.
