# CHEMICAL EQUATIONS

This shows what happens in a reaction using symbols and formulae. The substance that enters into the chemical is called reactant and it is on the left side of the equation. The formula of the substance produced is called products and it is on the right side of the equation.
<br>An arrow separates the reactant from the product.

      A    +    B  ----->                           C
	(Reactant)      (Reaction)	            (Product)


In chemical equation, symbols are used instead of their names.

Sodium +  Chlorine ------->             Sodium Chloride


Na         +  Cl ----------->                                               NaCl


Sometimes, there is more than one atom of each element. There is a relative number of atoms and molecules of both the reactants and products.

eg;     2H2 + O2 ------>          2H2O
