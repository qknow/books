# Ways of Preventing Rusting

Rusting can be prevented in order to maintain the value of the object. They can be prevented by:

**Plating:** The metal that can rust can be covered by less reactive metals or non-reactive metals.

**Alloying:** This is the mixture of two or more metals or non-metals. Metals which can wear easily e.g. irons are mixed with other form. This makes the iron or alloy not to rust.

**Coating:** The surfaces of iron or metal are coated with paint or grease.

**Cathode Protection:** This is the method of protecting iron from rusting by connecting it by wires to a more reactive metal such magnesium or zinc. This method is used when dealing with underground metallic pipe lines and tanks.

**Galvanizing the Iron:** This is when the iron is coated with a layer of zinc. This makes the zinc react with the environment rather than the iron.
