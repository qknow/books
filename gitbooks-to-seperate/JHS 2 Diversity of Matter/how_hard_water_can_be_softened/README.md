# How hard water can be softened

Letâ€™s perform this activity for softening hard water by boiling, addition of washing soda and distilling.

**Activity:**		How hard water can be softened.

**Materials:**	Sea water, measuring cylinder, Bunsen burner, bath of cold water, 3 test tubes/beakers, washing soda (sodium carbonate), liquid soap, stirrer, dropper.

**Method:**

1. Boil 100cm3 of sea water in a beaker for about 10 minutes.  Allow it to cool to room temperature by leaving the beaker in a bath of cold water for some few minutes.
2. Measure 25cm3 of this boiled sea water into a test tube and label it A.
3. Put about 100cm3 of the same sample of hard water in a beaker. Add a small amount of washing soda (sodium carbonate) and stir well with the stirrer to dissolve the washing soda. Continue stirring until all the washing soda has dissolved. Put 20 cm3 of the washing soda solution in a test tube and label it B.
4. Distil about 100cm3 of the same sample of hard water and collect 20cm3 of the distillate into another beaker and label it C. allow it to cool.
5. Add liquid soap to the samples A,B, and C. a drop at a time.
6. Tabulate your records in the table below.
