Find the Valency of Fluorine


Fluorine (9F)

Total number of electrons = 9

Number of electrons contained in the various shell

K shell = 2

L shell = 7


The electrons in the outermost shell make the atom unstable. Fluorine can be made stable by gaining an electron to its outermost shell. When an electron is gained, Fluorine becomes

Proton number of +9

Electron number of -10

The valency of fluorine = +9 â€“ 10

                         Fluorine = -1
