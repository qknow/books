# An activity to demonstrate the properties of water

This activity will be done by examining water from different sources.

We want to broaden our understanding on the topic so far through this activity.

**Activity:**		Examining water from different sources.

**Materials:**	Water from five different sources.
		The water sources to be used are: boreholes, rainwater, rivers, streams and well, 5 beakers, 5 pieces of filter paper and hand lens.

**Method:**

1. Collect the five samples of water from the sources. The sample should be 200cm3 each
2. Put each sample in a clean, labeled beaker. The labeling helps to differentiate between the sources. Keep the beaker in your class room undisturbed for 24 hours.
3. After 24 hours, observe each sample. <br>(a) Are there any particles settling at the bottom of the beaker? Record your observation.
4. Label five pieces of filter paper to match your five samples.
5. Sample each sample.
6. Look at each filtrate and describe the colour and the smell.
7. With your observations, do you think that the filtrates are fit to drink?

<br>

**NB**;    Do not taste the water because it might contain microbes which have passed through the filter paper.
