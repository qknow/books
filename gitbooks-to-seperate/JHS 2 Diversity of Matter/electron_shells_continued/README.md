# Electron Shells continued

**NB:** n is the shell number and its shows the number of shells of an element.

With the presentation above, letâ€™s calculate the number of electrons on each and every shell.

The K shell can take a maximum of 2 (12) = 2 electrons

The L shell can take a maximum of 2 (22) = 8 electrons

The M shell can take a maximum of 2 (32) = 18 electrons

The N shell can take a maximum of 2 (42) = 32 electrons

**NB:** M and N shell cannot take 18 and 32 electrons respectively instead a maximum of 8 electrons is contained in M and N respectively, this is due to the octet rule which talks about the maximum electron of eight (8) a shell can take.

**NB:** Each shell can only hold a certain maximum number of electrons.
