# Preparation of Salt Solution

**Title: **  	Preparation of Salt Solution

**Materials:**	 Cup/beaker, common salt, clean drinking water, stirrer.

**Method:**

1. Pour about 300cm3 of clean drinking water into a cup.
2. Add a spoonful of common salt to the water.
3. Wait for about 5 minutes. <br>(a) Record your observation
4. By using your stirrer or your stirring rod, stir the mixture carefully, for about 2 minutes for the salt to dissolve. <br>(b) Record your observation again <br>(c)Taste the solution and record your observation again

<br>

The general observation of this experiment is that, the salt (**solute**) will dissolve in the water (**solvent**). The taste of the mixture will change. The mixture will now change into solution. The mixture will now change into salt solution. The taste of the solution will be salty.


**NB:** The substances which form a mixture thus the salt and water will retain their individual properties.

None of the substances will lose their properties.

With the explanation above, we can say that solution is solely a solute and solvent solution results in a uniform (homogeneous) mixture of solute and solvent. Solute is the substance that dissolves in the solvent.

Solvents dissolve other substances.

There are various types of solvents. We have industrial solvents such as **ethanol**.

These types of solvents are mostly found in industries. We have domestic solvents such as water. This is found in our homes.
Solvents are used to dissolve in order to make it easy for use.
