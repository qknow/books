# METHODS OF SEPARATING MIXTURES (III)

**FILTRATION**

We have an appropriate way of insoluble solid separation from water. This method is known as filtration. This method is done at the laboratory or industry.

**Activity:** 	  Filtration.

**Material:**	Sand, beaker containing water, empty beaker, filter paper, filter funnel.

**Method:**

1. Put some sand into a beaker containing water. <br>(a) What do you observe?
2. Stir the mixture. <br>(b) What do you observe?
3. Fix the filter paper in the filter funnel very well and place it on empty beaker.
4. Filter the mixture by pouring the mixture into the filter paper. Collect the liquid that comes through the filter paper into the empty beaker. <br>(c) What do you observe on the filter paper? <br>(d) What do you observe in the beaker? <br>(e) Record your observations.

The method of separation above is known as **filtration**. The sand mixed with water is separated by this method and this gives an accurate separation.

When the mixture is poured on the filter paper it traps the sand particles, these particles are known as **residues**.

The water that passes through the filter paper is known as **filtrates**. The water and sand are separated after this experiment is performed. The water will be cleaner once the experiment is performed several times.

In our homes, where we do not have a filter paper, a clean cloth, mostly white cloak can be used for this separation method.
