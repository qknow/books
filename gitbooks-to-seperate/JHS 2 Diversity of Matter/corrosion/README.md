# Corrosion
Corrosion is the wearing away of the surface of a metal by the action of a chemical reaction between the metal and its environment (oxygen or air, water and acid).

Metals which are non-reactive are used to coat metals which are reactive in order to prevent corrosion.

Corrosion takes place in many ways, they are:

The wearing away of human skins by use of toning creams.

Acid rains falling on painting of buildings.

The paintings are washed off when that happens.

Old dry cells corroding metal container of electric touches due to the chemical in the old cells.
