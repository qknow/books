# Differences between Mixtures and Compounds

Two different experiments or activities will be done in order to broaden our understanding. The experiment to be done will be based on iron fillings and sulphur mixed to become a mixture and the other, the same iron fillings and sulphur introduced to heat in order for a compound to be formed. We will use the magnetic way of separation to try to separate the iron fillings from the sulphur in both experiments.

Before performing these experiments, let me make this clear; the components of a mixture, still has their original properties. Let me explain, when you mix the iron fillings with the sulphur, you obtain a mixture but the individual properties of the components  (iron fillings and the sulphur) are still the same. But when iron fillings and sulphur are brought together and heat is introduced, they become compounds. The properties of the individual components become different.


**NB:** The components of a mixture still have their original properties, and they can be separated by physical methods. When different elements are chemically combined, they form a new substance that has different properties.
