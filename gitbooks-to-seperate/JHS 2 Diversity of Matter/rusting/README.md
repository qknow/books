# Rusting

Rusting is a type of corrosion that happens to only irons. With this concept, we can define rusting as the gradual wearing away of the surface of an iron due to a reaction between the iron and the environment (oxygen and water).

Iron rust when oxygen and moisture are present. The iron reacts with them to form hydrated-oxide of iron which is reddish-brown. The chemical equation of rust;


4Fe(5) + 3O2(g) + YH2O â†’ 2Fe2O3(S) . YH2O
