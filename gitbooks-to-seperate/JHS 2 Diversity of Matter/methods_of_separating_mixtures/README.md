# METHODS OF SEPARATING MIXTURES

Substances which form a mixture will retain their individual properties. Mixed substances can be separated in order to obtain the individual substances mixed.

There are various methods used in separating mixtures. Some of the mixtures can be separated by using their physical properties.

The separation of groundnuts from rice is done by using the physical properties of the rice or groundnuts and prickling them out in order to be separated.

**USING METALS**

There is another separation done based on magnetic attraction. This is the mixture involving solids. A Magnet is used in the separation. The magnetic material is attracted to the magnet.
