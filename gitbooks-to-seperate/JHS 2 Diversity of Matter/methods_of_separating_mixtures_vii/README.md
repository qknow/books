# METHODS OF SEPARATING MIXTURES (VII)

**THE USE OF SEPARATING FUNNEL FOR SEPARATION**

This is the separation done between immiscible liquids. These are liquids which do not mix thoroughly. An example is palm oil mixed with water. This mixture can be separated by the use of a separating funnel.

The palm oil when mixed with water, forms on the surface of water because palm oil is less dense than water. Less dense liquids, form on the surfaces of denser liquids.

An activity has been performed below to broaden our understanding on the topic.

**Activity		:**	The use of separating funnel to separate palm oil from water.

**Materials	:**	Palm oil, water, 2 beakers, separating funnel.

**Method:**

Pour some water and palm oil into a separating funnel.
The mixture must be shaken thoroughly and allow to stand for some time.
	<br>a. Record your observation.

Place a beaker under the tap of the separating funnel. Remove the stopper and open the tap slowly. The liquid at the lower layer will flow into the beaker. This must be done slowly in order to prevent the liquid at the top layer from entering into the beaker.
	<br>b. Record the liquid collected into the beaker.

Place another beaker under the separating funnel and remove the stopper again in order for the liquid at the top layer to be collected into the beaker.
	<br>c. Which liquid remained in the funnel?

**NB:** The liquid were separated due to their density level. The palm oil settled on top of water because palm oil is less dense than water.
