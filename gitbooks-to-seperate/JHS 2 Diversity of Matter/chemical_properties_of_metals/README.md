# Chemical properties of Metals

Some metals react with acids, oxygen and water to produce compounds. Reactivity of such metals differs. Some metals react with acid, whiles others react with oxygen or water.

**Examples are given below:**

Reaction with dilute hydrochloric acid

**Zn + 2HCl → Zn Cl2 + H2**

The reaction is between zinc and dilute hydrochloric acid to form zinc chloride and hydrogen gas.

**Reaction with Water**

**2Li + H2O → Li2O + H2**

The reaction is between lithium and water to form lithium oxide and hydrogen gas.


<br>

**Reaction with Oxygen**

**2Mg + O2 → 2MgO**

The reaction is between magnesium and oxygen to form magnesium oxide.

Whiles some metals can react with other substances, others cannot react; those metals are known as **non-reactive metals**.

Examples of non-reactive metals are gold, silver, platinum etc. those metals do not react with other substance and that is why they used in making ornaments and jewelry.
