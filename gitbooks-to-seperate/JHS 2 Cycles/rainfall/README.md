# Rainfall

Rainfall is greatly linked to wind. As established earlier, wind is the fast movement of air into a low pressure area, the existing air is then moved upward.  The rising air then expands and cools.  This cold air cannot hold as much water vapour as the warm air can, so the water vapour condenses to form clouds. These clouds form rain.

The whole process is a cycle known as **water cycle**.

The definition of rainfall is the amount of water vapour that condenses and falls to the ground.

The instrument for measuring rainfall is the **rain gauge**

**The effects of rainfall on agriculture**

1.	 High rainfall causes crops and farm animals to grow well.

2.	High rainfall can also cause water pollution.  Dirt is washed or moved into our water bodies.

3.	Low rainfall results in drought

4.	High rainfall also results in flood.  This destroys crops and kills farm animals

5.	High rainfall also destroys animal habitats.
