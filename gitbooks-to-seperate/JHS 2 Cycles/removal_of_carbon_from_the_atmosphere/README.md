# Removal of carbon from the atmosphere

This is the process whereby carbon is removed from the atmosphere.  This can be further divided into two processes.

In order to give a better understanding, let’s treat them one after the other.

1. Photosynthesis

This is the process by which green plants prepare their own food.  The food preparation needs some conditions and substances.  Carbon dioxide is needed on photosynthesis.  Plants remove carbon from the atmosphere by using carbon (iv) oxide in the photosynthesis process.  This process helps plant remove carbon from the atmosphere.

The overall reaction of photosynthesis is;

Carbon dioxide + water + solar energy → glucose + oxygen.

2. Feeding

After the photosynthesis process the carbon compound will be found in the plants, they will be transferred to the animals through feeding.
