# Intensity of Light (Sunlight)

This is the amount of sunlight that reaches an area exposed to animals and plants.  This element has a direct influence on plants because green plants use it to prepare their own food.  This is what we call photosynthesis. But animals indirectly use it by feeding on plants after they have undergone their photosynthesis.  Intensity of sunlight of a place is related to the temperature of a place. Thus, the intensity of light also determines the temperature of a place.

The instrument for measuring the intensity of light is called the **photometer**.
