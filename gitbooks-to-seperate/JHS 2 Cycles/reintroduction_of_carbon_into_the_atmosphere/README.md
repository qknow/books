# Reintroduction of Carbon into the atmosphere

We will now look at how carbon is released back into the atmosphere thus confirming the Carbon cycle.

Carbon released back to the atmosphere can be divided into three processes.

The first process to be looked at is **combustion**.


a) **Combustion** is the release of energy from fuel by burning.

**Alternative Definition:**

-	The burning of fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal, releases carbon compounds into the atmosphere.


When plants and animals are burnt, a lot of carbon dioxide is also released into the atmosphere.  This is because plants and animals contain carbon dioxide.

b) **Decomposition**

This is when dead plants and animals that have decayed release the carbon compounds in them into the atmosphere. Plants and animals contain carbon dioxide.

c) **Respiration**

This is the process by which animals and plants release energy from their food.  This process makes animals release carbon dioxide in large quantities into the atmosphere.  Plants also do same but in small quantity.
