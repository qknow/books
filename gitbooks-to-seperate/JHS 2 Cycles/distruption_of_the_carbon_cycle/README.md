# DISTRUPTION OF THE CARBON CYCLE
The carbon cycle should bring balance of Carbon production to the atmosphere and carbon usage.  All the carbon produced, should be used.  Some human activities have brought – up changes in this particular process.  The carbon produced is now more than the carbon being used.  The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is increasing.  The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should be around 0.03% - 0.04% but has increased due to some excessive human activities such as burning of fossil fuels, pollution, deforestation, etc.

Carbon dioxide is part of the gases in the atmosphere that keeps the earth warm.  These gases are called **greenhouse gases**.  They trap a lot of heat, warming up the earth.

There are some human activities that disrupt this carbon cycle.  They are:

1.	 Excessive release of carbon (iv) oxide through pollution of the environment, killing living organisms.

2.	Destruction of the forest or deforestation
3.	The burning of fossil fuels
