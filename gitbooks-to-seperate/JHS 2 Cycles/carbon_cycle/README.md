# Carbon Cycle

Carbon is an important element with an atomic number of (6).  It forms the basis of all organic molecules and is needed throughout human and plant activities.  They can be found in plants, animals and human bodies.  Some human activities also lead to its production.  Since it is needed by all living things, they are obtained through an inter-relating process and that forms its cycle.

Carbon cycle is the circulation of carbon between the living, the dead organisms and the atmosphere.  The carbon which is removed from the atmosphere, ends up coming back in to the atmosphere. This act of removing and receiving carbon is what we term as the **"Carbon Cycle"**

Carbon Cycles can be divided in two ways, which are;

a) Removal of Carbon from the atmosphere

b) Reintroduction of Carbon into the atmosphere
