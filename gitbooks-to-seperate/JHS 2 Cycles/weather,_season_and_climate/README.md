# WEATHER, SEASON AND CLIMATE
The **weather** is the atmospheric conditions of a particular place during a short period of time. The same weather conditions do not remain over a particular place for a long time.  It changes from time to time depending on the location.  For example, the weather condition in Germany is different from the weather condition in Ghana.  The weather condition changes, thus it can be cloudy now and within a short period of time, the sun will shine.

The air mass influences the weather condition.  The air mass is the amount of air at a particular place.

When the air mass is low, we experience dry weather but when the air mass is high the weather becomes cold.

In Ghana for instance, we experience two weather conditions for the whole year.  We have the rainy season which is around April to December.  During this time, the air mass is high and this makes the weather cold.  We also have what we call the dry season and that occurs around December to March.  This season has low weather conditions and this makes this weather dry.

**Climate** is the average weather conditions of a place, usually measured over a long period of time. Climate is different from weather.

For example, a particular place with a high record of rainfall for a long period of time, will have a cold climate.
