# Relationship between climate and Vegetation Zones

The climate of an area determines the kind of vegetation in that area.  The vegetation of Ghana is divided into six zones.  They are:

1.	Tropical forest
2.	Guinea Savannah
3.	Coastal Savannah
4.	Tropical rain forest
5.	Mangrove
6.	Sudan Savannah


All these vegetation types in Ghana are affected by the climate.  The weather condition affects the climate and climate also affects the vegetation zone.  Favourable weather such as moderate rainfall, moderate sun light intensity and temperature will help plants grow well.  The prolonged good weather will have a positive effect on the climate. When the climate is good the vegetation in that particular area will be affected thus, they will grow well.

When plants grow well in a particular vegetation zone, animals of different species will migrate to that particular vegetation zone due to the availability of food (plant)
