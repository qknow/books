# Weather and climate are cyclic in nature

As we have already said about weather, it is the atmospheric conditions of a particular place over a short period of time. We have weather conditions which are influenced by the particular time of the month in Ghana; these are the **wet season** and the **dry season**.  The wet season is the rainy season which occurs from April to December and the dry season which occurs from December to March.  Weather can also be influenced due to the period of the day.  During the day time, we have hot weather and at night we have cold weather.

The weather condition is constant for every year.  Thus, we know from the beginning of every year from April to December we will experience wet season and December to March is our dry season.  We also know that we will experience a sunny day during the day time unless the air mass of that particular time has lots of moisture and this makes the weather cloudy.  During the night, we know that the weather would be cold compared to day time.  These conditions over a long period of time is called climate.  When the weather in a particular area changes over a long period of time, the climate also changes.  This is because, weather and climate are related.

Some human activities affect our weather and climate.  They are causing weather and climate change.  Some of these activities are:

1.	Deforestation

2.	Pollution such as air pollution

3.	Oil exploration.
