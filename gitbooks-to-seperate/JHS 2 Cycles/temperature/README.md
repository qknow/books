# Temperature
This is the degree of hotness or coldness of the atmosphere at a particular time.  It can be measured with a thermometer.  The earth experiences warm weather during day- time and cold weather at night.  This is because during the day, we experience the sun rays beaming down into the earthâ€™s atmosphere which warms it up.  During the night, the warm Earth radiates the heat

**The effects of temperature on agriculture**

1.	 High temperature, increases bushfires.  When vegetation dries out it allows easy travel of bushfires and this destroying farm lands.

2.	High temperature causes water bodies (rivers, fish ponds etc) to dry up making them inhabitable for marine life.

3.	Temperature is also needed for photosynthesis
4.	High temperature increases rate of water loss in both plants and animals.

5.	It causes low food production because some crops cannot withstand this condition
