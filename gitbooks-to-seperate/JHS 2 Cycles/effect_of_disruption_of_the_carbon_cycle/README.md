# Effect of disruption of the carbon cycle
All these activities above cause the disruption of the carbon cycle.  The carbon in the environment is more than the carbon used.  This results in the increase of carbon dioxide on earth.  Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.  Greenhouse gases keep the heat in causing the earth to warm up).  The effect of increase in carbon dioxide gas results in warming up of the earth surface this leads into what we call **greenhouse effect** or **global warming**. The increase in greenhouse gases causes **climate change**.

If this is not managed there will be serious repercussions making the earth almost inhabitable for all living things.
