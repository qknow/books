**Importance of Carbon Cycle**

Carbon is really important to animals and plants.  It is usually in the form of compounds such as carbon dioxide, Carbohydrates, etc.

The carbon cycle helps carbon dioxide to be available for plants to make food for animals.  Plants need carbon dioxide to prepare their own food for animals to also feed on them.  This process also helps to release oxygen needed by animals for respiration.

The carbon cycle also makes up a percentage of the atmospheric content which helps in the energy balance of the earth and also maintaining the good flow of the ecosystem.
