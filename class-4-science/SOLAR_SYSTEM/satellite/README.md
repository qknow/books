# Satellite
This is any object like a moon or a planet that orbits another planet or a star like the sun.

The earth and the other 8 planets are satellites because they orbit the sun.

The Earthâ€™s moon is a satellite because it orbits the Earth same with other moons orbiting other planets.

These satellites mentioned above are called natural satellites, this is because there are also another type of satellite called artificial (manmade) satellites which have been placed in orbit.

There are over 1000 artificial satellites orbiting the Earth for various purposes (navigation, weather, observation, space exploration and communication to name a few)
