# SYSTEMS
**The Solar System**

The solar system is made up of all the planets (in our case 9 planets) that orbit the sun. Our solar system is in a galaxy called the **Milky Way**.

The solar system consists of the 9 planets which are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.

There are also moons that orbit some of these planets, dwarf planets, chains of asteroids, comets, debris and gas.

The sun is the largest star in the solar system and it is at the center. It is made up of a combination of burning gases. All the other planets and objects in the solar system orbit the sun. The sunâ€™s gravity keeps it in place and helps pull the other objects towards it and prevents them from going off course into outer space.
