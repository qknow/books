# The Moon
The moon is a natural satellite that orbits the earth. It is the 5th largest natural satellite in the solar system.

The moon goes around the earth in an oval like orbit with the same side facing the earth always. It completes this orbit in a month and this is called “Sidereal Month”

During this orbit the moon appears as different shapes in the sky.

IMPORTANT FACTS
The pull of the moon’s gravity causes High tide and low tides of the oceans.
The moon is the only other object (planet/satellite) in the solar system that has been visited by man.
It does not have an atmosphere like earth or the other planets and the sky always appears black. It is easily exposed to the sun’s rays and any other debris that comes into contact with it. It is said a footprint can stay on its surface for centuries without being wiped off.
Scientists discovered that the moon is gradually drifting away from Earth. 3cm per year.
Due to the moon’s size it has a weaker gravity than earth, which means any object on earth would weigh much less on the moon.
The low gravity makes movements like jumping a bit more exaggerated and humans can leap or jump further than if they were on earth.
The moon has craters (holes) in it and is jokingly said to be made of cheese.
