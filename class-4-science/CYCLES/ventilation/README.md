# Ventilation
It is the replacement of stuffy unclean (or polluted) air with fresh air.

**Alternative**
-	The process of supplying fresh air to an enclosed space and removing air contaminated by odors gases or smoke. (thefreedictionary.com)

When we talk about ventilation our minds go to opening up windows in a room or building to allow in fresh air. This fresh air helps us breathe and reduces the temperature in the room.

For ventilation to take place there should be enough space for circulation of air to take place. Air should be able to move in and out of the room. This is where **ventilation and convection** work together.

**Ventilation & Convection**

In order for natural ventilation to take place 2 conditions are necessary
1.	The winds outside the room
2.	Convection currents in the room.


 Add to those 2 conditions the room should have big and wide enough windows or a roof vent to facilitate the escape of air and introduction of new air.

In the room cooler air is denser and sinks to the bottom to replace the heated air which has now become less dense and rises up. The windows or roof vent allows the warm air to escape the room and then allows more cool air to enter the room.

**Roof Vent:** It is an opening in the roof with a cover to keep out rain and any other big objects coming into the room.
