# Ventilation of Rooms
We spend most of our days inside rooms and buildings as we work, relax, sleep etc (you get it right?). we know once in a while kids come out to play and get fresh air but adults  spend less time outside which is not healthy. Most air that surrounds us is not completely free from pollutants and the air in rooms is also the same. It is necessary to have well ventilated rooms which will limit health hazards.

Well ventilated rooms will give us clean air to breathe and prevents us from falling sick.

It helps us perform our duties, office work and school work effectively and efficiently.

**Causes of Poor Ventilation**
-	Lack of fresh air supply caused by lack of sufficient windows and vents in a room to recycle air.
