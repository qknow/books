**Convection**

Convection is one of the **three (3) types** of heat transfer (others are **conduction** and **radiation**) Convection occurs when warm air or liquid with rapidly moving atoms rise and are replaced by cold air or liquid with slower moving particles.

**Alternative Definitions**
-	The transfer of heat through fluids from a warmer area to a cooler area. (Science Dictionary)

**Things to note about Convection:**
-	Particles in fluids move from one place to another when heated.
-	Heated air/liquid rises because it is less dense than cold air/liquid.
-	Heated air/liquid rises cools down and then drops back down again
-	It is a continuous cycle.
-	It only occurs in fluids ie. Liquids and gases. Atoms/molecules are free to move in these substances
-	Can only occur in places with varying temperatures.
