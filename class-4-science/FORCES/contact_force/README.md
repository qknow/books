# Contact Force
**Frictional force:** This is when 2 objects rub against each other. When you slide on the floor with your knees you will feel a burn, that is frictional force.  **IMAGE**

**IMPORTANTFACT:**

Friction is very important for activities like walking, running, driving etc.  When you walk your feet push against the ground and the ground pushes back. If there was no friction on the surface you would slip. That’s why we cannot walk well on extra wet or smooth surfaces like ice.

**Normal Force:** this is an upward force that balances the weight of objects on any surface. It keeps them from falling through the surface. (It works against gravity, gravity pulls you down and normal force pushes you up) **IMAGE**

**Tension Force:** It’s the pulling force on an object when it is hung on a string. **IMAGE**

**Compression:** It is the application of power on an object that causes it to squeeze. **IMAGE**
