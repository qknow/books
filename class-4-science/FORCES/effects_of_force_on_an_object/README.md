# Effects of Force on an object
 A force can cause an object to change shape. Change from its original shape and size when compressed to another shape. An example here is when we squeeze a foam ball or crush a can of coke, they change their shape and size. **IMAGE EXAMPLE**

 A force can cause an object to move which was not already in motion. A ball being kicked moves it from one spot to another. **IMAGE EXAMPLE**

  A force can cause an object that was already moving to stop. When riding a bicycle the tires are in motion, once brakes are applied sharply the tire stops suddenly. **IMAGE EXAMPLE
**

A force can increase or decrease the speed of an object already in motion. A ball already moving can pick up speed when thereâ€™s a stronger force applied to it. A car moving at top speed can slow down when brakes are applied lightly. **IMAGE EXAMPLE**

A force can change the direction of a moving object.
