# Types of Forces
There are two categories of forces. They are:

i. Contact Force

ii. Non-contact Force.

**Contact Force:** These types of forces occur when there is direct interaction between 2 objects. Under this category we have Frictional force, compression, normal force, tension.

**Non-contact Force:** This is when there is a force applied to one object by another object without direct contact. Examples are magnetic and gravitational force.
