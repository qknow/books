# Uses of Solar Energy
**Heating:** Solar energy can be used to heat water (some houses have solar panels installed to heat water) for bathing and washing. It can also be used to heat buildings during cold conditions and also used to cook.

**Road signs, traffic lights and street lights:** Road signs that determine how fast a vehicle is moving or warning of accidents ahead are now being powered by solar energy. Some traffic lights and street lights are powered by solar energy and perform the same functions as their predecessors efficiently.

**Satellites:** Satellites that transmit information (media, GPS) to our electronic devices like mobile phones etc directly or indirectly use solar energy as well.

**Charge and recharge devices:** Solar energy can be used to charge or recharge portable electronics which can in turn charge small devices like mobile phones, smart tabs etc. Some larger electronics can power bigger devices like laptops. This is an environmentally friendly way of charging your devices.
