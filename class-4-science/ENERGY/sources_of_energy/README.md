# Sources of Energy
**Solar Energy:** This is energy which is gotten from the sun. solar panels are used to collect energy from the sunâ€™s rays during the day and can be used straight away or stored to be used later at night. Due to the power crisis in Ghana (Dumsor) a lot of solar panels have been bought to be used in households and offices.

**Food:** The food we eat provides the body with energy to perform activities. Food contains chemical energy which is stored in the body. This energy is released when we perform physical activities like walking, running, exercising etc.

**Wind Energy: **this is an innovative way to provide energy. There are large windmills and turbines which are built in windy areas or fields and are called wind farms. As the wind blows it has the ability to turn the turbines which then creates power through a generator to produce energy.

**Water/ Hydroelectric Power:** This is a very common source of energy which generates power for a lot of countries worldwide. Ghana is no different, the Akosombo dam is noted for this. The force from the water is more than enough to turn generators to produce electricity.

**Crude Oil:** This is the most common source of energy in the world. The oil is converted into many products for consumption. Gasoline which must be the most significant is used for vehicles and aircrafts to transport from one place to another.

**Natural Gas:** This type of energy is used in heating etc.
