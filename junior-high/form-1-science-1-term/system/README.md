# Respiratory System of Humans

A lot of students do confuse themselves with the definition between respiration and breathing.

In order to broader our understanding on the topic, let us start by looking at their difference based on their definition.

<br>
####Respiration
This is defined as the process by which energy is obtained from food in the body of a living organism with or without the use of oxygen.

**Alternative Definitions** (Should be a button, when clicked on defns should roll down underneath)

1. Respiration is the process of releasing energy from the breakdown of glucose.

2. Respiration is the process by which the chemical energy of food molecules is released and partially captured in the form of energy.

Respiration takes place in every living cell at all times. All living things need to respire to produce the energy they require.

IMPORTANT FACT:

The average person reaches peak respiratory functions in their mid 20s and then starts to lose breathing capacity between 10%-27% for every decade of life.
