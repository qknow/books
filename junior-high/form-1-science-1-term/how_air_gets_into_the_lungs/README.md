# How Air Gets Into The Lungs

The air passes into the larynx, trachea, bronchus, bronchioles and then finally enters the alveoli in the lungs.

There are various organs that aid in the respiratory mechanism. They are the nostril, nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea, lungs, larynx, diaphragm, intercostal muscle, ribs and bronchi. In order to get an easy   and better understanding of the mechanism, let’s look at their functions;

####Breating In Mammals
Breathing is the inhalation (breathing in) of oxygen and the exhalation (breathing out) of carbon dioxide in animals
 With the functions of the respiratory organs above let’s talk about the gaseous exchange in mammals.

In mammals, inhaled air is moistened and warmed as it passes through the nasal passage .Cells leaving the nasal passage secrete sticky mucus in which germs and dust present in the air are trapped and prevented from entering the lungs. Within the lungs, each bronchus branches repeatedly to form a network of small tubes called the bronchioles.

The bronchioles ends in numerous tiny air sacs called alveoli. The lungs are situated in the thoracic cavity, (thorax).The heart is also situated in the thoracic cavity. The floor of the thorax is made of a sheet of muscle called the diaphragm which separates the thorax from the abdomen.
