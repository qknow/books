IMPORTANT FACT:

There are also 2 different types of exercise: Aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise. Strength training is an aerobic exercise whilst short distant sprints/running are anaerobic exercises. These 2 differ due to duration and intensity of muscular contractions and also from how energy is generated.

####SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ANAEROBIC AND AEROBIC RESPIRATION
Both anaerobic and aerobic respiration produces energy and carbon dioxide.

####EXTERNAL RESPIRATION OR EXCHANGE OF GASES
Beginning of this topic, we spoke about respiration being different from breathing in terms of its definition or process. Even though, breathing is a type of respiration, it is different by the way of its process. Breathing which is also known as gaseous exchange is an external respiration whereby gas is exchanged between a living organism and its surroundings.
