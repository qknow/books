# Anaerobic Respiration

There is no oxygen involved in this type of respiration. (“an” means without). Sometimes there is not enough oxygen for animals and plants to respire but they still need energy to survive so they do this through Anaerobic Respiration.  Only a small amount of energy is produced.

It is called alcoholic fermentation in yeast. Alcohol (ethanol) and carbon dioxide are produced as by-products with glucose been the substrate. Alcohol is produced due to fermentation. The chemical equation of anaerobic respiration has been summarized below;

C6H12O6    =    2C2H5OH + 2CO2    +    Energy
Raw products      by products          main products

The actual representation is; **Glucose=Alcohol+ Carbon dioxide +Energy**

IMPORTANT FACTS (Anaerobic Respiration):

<u>In Animals:</u>
When carrying out vigorous exercise the heart and lungs are not able to get sufficient amount of oxygen to our muscles in order for them to respire. Thus anaerobic respiration takes place. However only a small amount of energy is produced here, because the glucose is only partially broken down. A poisonous chemical called Lactic Acid is also produced, if it builds up it causes the muscles to stop working causing cramps.
Oxygen is needed to rid the body of lactic acid. Oxygen Debt is the amount of oxygen needed to rid the body of Lactic Acid.


<u>In Plants:</u>
Oxygen in plants can also run out when the soil gets waterlogged, anaerobic respiration has to take place.
