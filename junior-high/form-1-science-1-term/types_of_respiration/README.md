# Types of Respiration

We have two main types of respiration. They are
1. Internal respiration or Tissue respiration.
2. External respiration or Exchange of gases.

####Internal Respiration
It is the chemical process which occurs in cells and results in the breakdown of organic food substances with the release of energy as the main product and carbon dioxide and water as the by- products. Internal respiration talks about respiration itself. It can take place with or without the participation of oxygen whereas energy is mostly obtained from carbohydrates by internal respiration.

Carbohydrates which are obtained from food we take into our system produces energy after respiration. When the energy is produced in the presence of oxygen, it is known as aerobic respiration whilst the one without oxygen is anaerobic respiration. We have two types of internal respiration. They are; **Aerobic respiration** and **Anaerobic respiration**.

**Aerobic respiration** takes place in the presence of oxygen. There is the production of great amount of energy. Glucose is the substrates or reactant in the chemical process of aerobic respiration while carbon dioxide and water are produced as by-products. The chemical equation of aerobic reparation has been summarized below;

<pre>
C6H12O6+6O2 = 6CO2 +6HO2+energy

	        By-products      Main product
</pre>

The actual representation is: **Glucose +Oxygen = Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy**

Aerobic Respiration takes place in animals as well as plants. Oxygen enters plant cells through the stomata. Plants produce their food via photosynthesis and release energy from it through the process of respiration.

IMPORTANT FACTS (Aerobic Respiration):

During the day both photosynthesis and respiration takes place at the same time, photosynthesis however occurs at a faster rate. At night where there is no light only respiration takes place.

Aerobic exercise (cardio) is physical exercise that relies on aerobic energy-generating process. Oxygen is used to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism. Example of these exercises are; Swimming, running or jogging, walking and cycling
