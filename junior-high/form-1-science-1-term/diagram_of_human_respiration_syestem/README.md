####Parts Of The Human Respiratory System And Their Function

| Structure | Function |
| -- | -- |
| **Nostril** | it traps dust particles contained in the inhaled air from the atmosphere with the aid of the hairs in the nostril. |
| **Nasal cavity** | it is responsible for detecting smell. It also warms inhaled air and traps any microbes present in air with the help of its mucus  living. |
| **Pharynx** | it is lined with mucus and hairs which help to filter inhaled air |
| **Trachea** | it acts as a passage through which inhaled air gets to the lungs and exhaled air gets to the atmosphere Lined with cilia and contains mucus secreting cells to filter air passing through it so as to protect the lungs. It is also called wind |
| **Lungs** | They are the main organs for   gaseous exchange which place in the alveoli. |
| **Larynx** | Contains vocal cords, which vibrate to produce sound when one is speaking. It also lined with ciliated epithelium and mucus secreting cells which help to trap dust particles and microbes in the air. |
| **Diaphragm** | Relaxes and contracts to aid gas exchange during breathing. |
| **Intercostal muscle** | regulates the variation of the movement of ribs to aid external respiration |
| **Ribs** | Protects the lungs and also aids in breathing |
| **Bronchi** | Strengthened by incomplete rings of cartilage to keep it open for passage of air in the alveoli |
