# Importance Of Respiration

Respiration produces chemical energy to a living organism. The energy is used in many life activities such as;

1.	Cell division
2.	Breathing of chemical substances in cells.
3.	Transmission of nerve impulses.
4.	Heat production which enables to maintain constant in body temperatures.
5.	Muscle contraction which causes movement in animals
6.	Building larger molecules from smaller ones. Example: Building protein from amino acid.


Both animals and plants use nutrients during respiration, example of these nutrients are; **Sugar**, **Amino acids** and **Fatty acids**.
