# The Breathing Mechanism

During inhalation(breathing in)there is an increase in the volume of the chest cavity caused by lowering of the diaphragm and raisin up the ribs .The increase in volume of the chest cavity causes a decrease in air pressure in the lungs hence oxygen from the atmosphere rushes into the lungs.

During exhalation (breathing out) ,the volume of the chest cavity reduces due to  the curvature of the diaphragm and the lowering of the ribs .The decrease in the volume of the chest cavity causes an increase  in the air pressure in the lungs, hence carbon dioxide in the lungs rushes out into the atmosphere through the nostril.
